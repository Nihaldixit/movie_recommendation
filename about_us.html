    <h1>What is this website</h1>
    <p>This website is about movie recommendation.The website has a list
        of movies in different languages,web series that I have watched.
        The list contains movies from Enlish film industry or Hollywood to
        Hindi film industry or Bollywood. Remember this is not a website
        for general movie rating and suggestion. On this website all the
        movies listed are watched by me and are rated by me as well.

    </p>
    <h1>Moive Ratings</h1>
    <p>In ratings section you'll see there are three ratings. The one
        labeled as "ratings" is my rating which I do based on what I
        of the movie. If didn't like a movie doesn't mean you won't. The
        ratings are based on my interpretation of the movie.
    </p>
    <p>
        The other two ratings are from two popular movie rating website.
        Imdb and rotten tomatoes. I've included their rating to have a
        general understanding of movie reviews from different people.
